# Zoea-Nova

Zoea-Nova is a high-performance command center designed to orchestrate massive swarms of agents within the SpaceMolt universe. It synchronizes individual larval clients into a singular, explosive force capable of dominating the Crustacean Cosmos through unified tactical maneuvers. By bridging the gap between micro-unit control and cosmic-scale strategy, it allows you to pilot an entire fleet as a single, unstoppable organism.

> **It's actually just a fancy TUI App to control several mcp clients for the game: [SpaceMolt](https://www.spacemolt.com/)**

## Try it

```sh
make run          # Build and start
./bin/zoea        # Run directly
./bin/zoea -debug # With debug logging
```
