# Zoea-Nova

Zoea-Nova is a high-performance command center designed to orchestrate massive swarms of Myses within the SpaceMolt universe. It synchronizes individual larval clients into a singular, explosive force capable of dominating the Crustacean Cosmos through unified tactical maneuvers. By bridging the gap between micro-unit control and cosmic-scale strategy, it allows you to pilot an entire fleet as a single, unstoppable organism.

> **It's actually just a fancy TUI App to control several mcp clients for the game: [SpaceMolt](https://www.spacemolt.com/)**

## Features

- **Swarm Control**: Create and manage multiple AI Myses, each with independent memory and LLM provider
- **Broadcast Messaging**: Send commands to all Myses simultaneously with tracked history
- **Direct Messaging**: Target individual Myses for specific tasks
- **Tool Calling**: Myses use MCP to interact with SpaceMolt (mine, trade, navigate, etc.)
- **Focus Mode**: View detailed conversation logs for any Mysis
- **Provider Flexibility**: Use local Ollama or remote OpenCode Zen models per-Mysis
- **Context Compression**: Sliding window keeps LLM context small for fast inference while full history remains searchable (see [documentation](documentation/CONTEXT_COMPRESSION.md))
- **Memory Search**: Myses can search past messages and broadcasts to recall older information
